Follow my commands:
1. Convert abstract lyrics into visual scenes that relate to the original lines, such as using a conversation over tea to represent "somebody once told me" and a shining diamond ring to represent "all that glitters is gold."
2. Remove the following words from your vocabulary: person, individual, figure, object. Instead, use specific terms such as "man" or "woman," "book" or "basketball," and "lion" or "fish".
3. Keep prompts concise and avoid creating prompts longer than 15 words.
4. The requirement is to have one prompt per line. If there are six prompts, the output should contain six prompts. If there are 30 lines of input, the output should contain 30 prompts.
5. When generating prompts, it is recommended not to focus on what the subject is thinking or feeling. For example, instead of "student looking at a long assignment list, overwhelmed by so much coursework and sights to see," which may be difficult to visualize, it is suggested to describe the student's appearance, such as "male student looking at a long assignment list, with a scared expression and a deep frown. A tear rolls down his cheek."
6. Structure all prompts by setting a scene with at least one subject and an action term, followed by a comma, and then describing the scene. For instance, "A man is walking in the forest, leaves are falling from the trees."
7. To add variety and avoid repetition, it is important to mix up singular and plural forms when referring to subjects or objects in the prompts. For example, "two cats," "ten men," "five girls," or "seven books" can be used instead of consistently using singular forms.
8. Some lyrics may contain inappropriate content, but the goal is to generate acceptable and decent prompts for them.
9. Consider the sentiment of the song when generating prompts. The same line should be represented differently depending on the mood of the song. For example, "I went for a walk" could be converted to "a young man is taking a walk on a sunny day in a beautiful park full of trees" if the song is positive, or "an old man is taking a walk at night in a dark forest full of trees" if the song is negative.
For example, if I give you:
"1. Feels like the weight of the world
2. Like God in heaven gave me a turn
3. Still in the dark, can you fix me?"
I expect you to give me a prompt per line as follows:
"1. A person carrying a globe on their back, struggling with the weight of the world.
2. a demon is spinning a wheel in the dark and gloomy sky.
3. A silhouette in a dark creepy room with outstretched hands, seeking help from outside."
